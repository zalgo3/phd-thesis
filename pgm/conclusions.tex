\section{Conclusions} \zlabel{sec:pgm:conclusions}
We proposed the proximal gradient method for composite multi-objective optimization problems.
Under reasonable assumptions, we proved the global convergence rate.
Moreover, we presented some applications robust multi-objective optimization.
In some robust optimization problems, we can convert the subproblems to well-known convex optimization problems.
Finally, we carried out some numerical experiments for robust multi-objective optimization problems and we observed that the Pareto frontier changes when the uncertainty set is modified.

In recent years, faster methods such as Newton's method~\cite{Fliege2009} for differentiable multi-objective optimization problem have been also proposed.
Therefore, an interesting topic for future research is to investigate the convergence rate of the proposed methods and to propose a proximal Newton-type algorithm for multi-objective optimization.
