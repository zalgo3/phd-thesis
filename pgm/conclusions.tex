\section{Conclusions} \zlabel{sec:pgm:conclusions}
We proposed the proximal gradient method for composite multi-objective optimization problems.
Under reasonable assumptions, we proved its global convergence and convergence rate.
Moreover, we presented some applications for robust multi-objective optimization.
We can convert the subproblems to well-known convex optimization problems in some robust optimization problems.
Finally, we carried out some numerical experiments for robust multi-objective optimization problems, and we observed that the Pareto frontier changes when the uncertainty set is modified.
