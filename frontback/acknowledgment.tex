This thesis summarizes the author's research during the enrollment in the doctoral course at the Department of Applied Mathematics and Physics, Graduate School of Informatics, Kyoto University. Professor Nobuo Yamashita and Associate Professor Ellen Hidemi Fukuda of the same department, my supervisors, allowed me to conduct this research and provided guidance throughout it. I want to express my deepest gratitude to them. 

I likewise thank the members of the System Optimization Laboratory, the scientists of the Operations Research Society of Japan, and many others for their valuable comments and suggestions at the workshops and conferences. I would also like to thank my friends and family for their emotional support.

Part of this research was supported by Grant-in-Aid for JSPS Fellows (20J21961) from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.
