\section{Conclusions}
We first proposed a simple merit function for~\cref{eq:MOO} in the sense of weak Pareto optimality and showed its lower semicontinuity.
We also defined a regularized merit function when~$F$ is convex and discussed its continuity, the way of evaluating it, its differentiability, and the properties of its stationary points.
Furthermore, when each~$F_i$ is composite, we introduced a regularized and partially linearized merit function in the sense of Pareto stationarity and showed similar properties.
In addition, we gave sufficient conditions for the proposed merit functions to be level-bounded and to provide error bounds.

We can consider a natural extension of our proposed merit functions for vector problems with an infinite number of objective functions.
We can also regard the generalization of other merit functions for scalar problems, such as the implicit Lagrangian~\cite{Mangasarian1993} and the squared Fischer-Burmeister function~\cite{Kanzow1996}, to multi-objective and vector problems.
These will be some subjects for future works.
