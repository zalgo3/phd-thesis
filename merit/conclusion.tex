\section{Conclusions} \zlabel{sec:merit:conclusions}
In this chapter, we first proposed a gap function for~\zcref{eq:MOO} in the sense of weak Pareto optimality and showed its lower semicontinuity.
We also defined a regularized gap function when~$F$ is convex and discussed its continuity, the way of evaluating it, its differentiability, and the properties of its stationary points.
Furthermore, when each~$F_i$ is composite, we introduced a regularized and partially linearized gap function in the sense of Pareto stationarity and showed similar properties.
In addition, we gave sufficient conditions for the proposed merit functions to be level-bounded and to provide error bounds.
