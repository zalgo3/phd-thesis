\section{Conclusions}
We have successfully accelerated the proximal gradient method for multi-objective optimization by putting information on the previous points into the subproblem.
Moreover, we have generalized the momentum factor in a form that is even new in the single-objective context and includes the known FISTA momentum factors~\cite{Beck2009,Chambolle2015}.
Furthermore, with the proposed momentum factor, we proved under reasonable assumptions that the algorithm has an~$O(1/k^2)$ convergence rate and that the iterates converge to Pareto solutions.
Moreover, the numerical results reinforced these theoretical properties and suggested the potential for our new momentum factor to improve the performance.
