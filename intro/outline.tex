\section{Outline of the thesis}
After introducing in \zcref{sec:preliminaries} some symbols, basic definitions, and their properties necessary for the discussion, \zcref{sec:merit} proposes and characterizes three new types of merit functions for non-smooth multi-objective optimization problems: the gap function for continuous problems, the regularized gap function for convex problems, and the regularized and partially linearized gap functions for composite problems.
\zcref{sec:pgm} develops the proximal gradient method for composite multi-objective optimization problems, describes its convergence, convergence rate, applications to robust multi-objective optimization, and performs numerical experiments.
\zcref{sec:acc_pgm} presents its acceleration applicable with \emph{convex} composite objectives: the accelerated proximal gradient method or Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (FISTA) and provides similar discussions.
We note here that our multi-objective FISTA represents a new algorithm even for single objectives, depending on the choice of acceleration factors, and performs better in numerical experiments.
