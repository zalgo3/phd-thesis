\subsection{Heuristics}
\emph{Heuristics} are approaches that do not necessarily lead to the optimal solution but can yield a solution close to the optima at some level.
Regarding the multi-objective context, in many cases, heuristics employ evolutionary algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms (GA) such as NSGA-II~\cite{Deb2002} and NSGA-III~\cite{Deb2014}, being practical for the Pareto frontier enumeration because they are multi-point search algorithms.
These approaches have had some success for real-world problems, but they have the disadvantage that there is no theoretical convergence guarantee to obtain a Pareto solution.
