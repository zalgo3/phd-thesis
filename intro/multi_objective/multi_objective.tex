\section{Multi-objective optimization} \zlabel{sec:intro:multi_objective}
Optimization problems usually deal with only one objective function.
However, many real-world problems have multiple objectives.
One solution to this is \emph{multi-objective optimization}, which minimizes several objective functions as follows:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:MOO}
    \min_{x \in C} \quad F(x)
,\end{equation} 
where~$C \subseteq \setR^n$ is a constraint set, and $F \colon \setR^n \to (-\infty, +\infty]^m$ is a vector-valued function with~$F \coloneqq (F_1, \dots, F_m)^\T$.
When~$m = 1$,~\zcref{eq:MOO} reduces to a single-objective optimization.
This model has many applications in engineering~\cite{Eschenauer1990}, statistics~\cite{Carrizosa1998}, and machine learning (particularly multi-task learning~\cite{Sener2018,Lin2019} and neural architecture search~\cite{Kim2017,Dong2018,Elsken2019}).

In most cases of~$m \ge 2$, no single point minimizes all objective functions simultaneously, so we use the concept of~\emph{Pareto optimality}, a generalization of the usual optimality for single-objective problems.
We say that~$y \in C$ \emph{Pareto dominates}~$x \in C$ if~$F_i(y) \le F_i(x)$ for all~$i = 1, \dots, m$ and~$F_j(y) < F_j(x)$ for at least one~$j = 1, \dots, m$, and we call a point \emph{Pareto optimal} if it is not Pareto dominated by any other point.
Generally, the Pareto optimal solution is not unique and constitutes a set.
We call such a set the \emph{Pareto frontier}.
The points in the Pareto frontier are in trade-off relationships with each other, and the decision-makers have to select a solution from it further.
