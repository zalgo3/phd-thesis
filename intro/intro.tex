\chapter{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
\emph{Optimization}, a branch of applied mathematics, minimizes (or maximizes) an objective function under given constraints.
It is a fundamental technique for operations research and machine learning.

This chapter first describes multi-objective optimization, the subject of this thesis, and composite optimization, a crucial class of non-smooth optimization.
It also explains the merit function, an analytical tool for optimization.
Finally, it identifies the research challenges on multi-objective optimization problems and explains this thesis's motivations, contributions, and outlines.
